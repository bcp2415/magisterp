  A bit about what I was doing before I arrived in Parkway:
  I grew up in the St. Louis area and graduated from Pattonville School District.  I studied philosophy at Rice University as an undergraduate, then earned a Master's degree in philosophy at the University of Chicago and did further graduate work in philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin.  I taught Latin and other subjects at Lamar High School in Houston, then decided to return to graduate school to earn a Ph.D. in ancient Greek philosophy.  I taught at Houston Community College for a year, then took a three-year job as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford.  There I worked as part of a large research project called Power Structuralism in Ancient Ontologies, located within the Faculty of Philosophy and at Corpus Christi College.

  I co-edited Causation and Creation in Late Antiquity  (Cambridge University Press, 2015), and have published four articles in academic journals on Plato's metaphysics.   My most recent article dealt with Plato's theory of medicine, which was (believe it or not!) taken seriously in the ancient world.  I also assisted with the translation and editing of this book.
